# Measurement of angles :mag_right:

This project offers a solution for the estimation of diseases related to repetitive efforts in the wrist. 
Different technologies are used such as inertial sensors, microprocessors for the communication of information, signal processing, data visualization among others.
* [Matlab tests](https://github.com/DavidRicardoGarcia/measurement-of-angles/tree/master/matlab%20tests)  In the matlab tests we can find some of the old tests that were done, most of them done in .m files
* [Xsens-Arduino](https://app.gitbook.com/@micros-uao/s/implementacion-con-xsens/comunicacion-utlizando-el-arduino-due) This link takes you to the information related to the Xsens-Arduino folder. Where are the codes used to establish the simultaneous 
communication of the processors with the inertial sensors located on the wrist and shoulder. 
This arrangement was used to take real-time data on the orientation of a worker's wrist and shoulder during their workday,in order to estimate the risks and possible illnesses that they have developed due to repetitive work activities.
* [GUI](https://app.gitbook.com/@micros-uao/s/implementacion-con-xsens/interfaz-grafica-con-pyqt5) This link takes you to the information related to the GUI folder, which is where the .py files in charge of processing the quaternions are located in order to obtain the 
angles of ulnar deviation, supination / pronation, flexion / extension and with these results the data is displayed in the graphical interface

[Final link](https://app.gitbook.com/@micros-uao/s/implementacion-con-xsens/): Finally, the link to the complete guide is attached with all the necessary information to understand the proposed project for estimating the relative angles between the wrist and the forearm. In this book, in addition to finding the previous information, 
you can find used hardware, recommendations and a detailed explanation of the use and implementation of each element of the project.
